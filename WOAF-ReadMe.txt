Working Ovens and Faucets for A17 stable

Just extract the WOAFpz folder into your mods folder.
These are new blocks so they will not mess with the ones spawned in the world.
The oven will function the same as a campfire.
To fill empty jars, cans, or buckets with the faucet right click on the faucet with an empty item in your clutches. Do not click on a sink block.

You can reach me on the official 7 Days To Die forums as Prinlgz46290 and by the same name on NexusMods for bug reporting or help with issues.
